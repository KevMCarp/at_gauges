Does this package publish to pub.dev or similar? This README will be the
first thing that developers see there and should be written such that it
lets them quickly assess if it fits their need.
-->
## Get started
There are two options to get started using this package.

[Example](./example) directory that you can use to create a personalized
copy using ```at_app create``` in four commands.

```sh
